- **1a.**

Let X = 2^k Geometrica currency demonitations that will make up the solution to the greedy algorithm, which is the fewest coins to sum up to a number, N.

This algorithm will find the largest demonitation of Geometrica that is lower than the given value, subtract the Geomtrica demonination and continually do so until we get to 0. The number of geometrica coins will then be added up, and this will be the optimal number of tokens.

The alrogithm is always optimal because it can recursively call itself 

x is possible number of decisions 

def greedy()

x = input
if x == 0
  return 0
elif x == 1
  return 1
else
n = 0
for 2^n > x
  n++
x - 2^n






- **2b.**
